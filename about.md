Since the summer of 2015, I have been in the startup field.  First, friend of mine from college and I joined an accelerator to create IoT product.

First product I tried to develop was a smart noise detection system for apartments and dormitories.  There have consistently been conflicts in such areas due to loud noise from the neighbours.  I aimed to solve this problem by collecting unbiased noise data from each room, so when the noise level exceeds, the system alerts the tenant to be careful.  By providing useful information at useful time, conflicts can be prevented.

Second product (the first project didn't last long, due to the difficulty and time-consuming nature of the product) was smart jewellery.  Though it was the era of wearables, no women I knew were wearing them.  I tried to make a jewellery-like smart bracelet to attract women.  They desired small, jewellery-like materials.  Both of which were very difficult to make real.  Due to the small size, antenna could not have been large enough, and due to the nature of metal, RF signals could not travel far.  I, again, was not able to reach production (got to pre-production, and quality was not satisfactory).  

Currently, I joined another startup buildilng smart diffuser.  I had no knowledge about the field, but I fell in love with in instantly.  Serving as the Technology Lead of the company, I hope to reach production this time.
